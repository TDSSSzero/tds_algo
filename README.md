# Algorithm Practice Repository

## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of my algorithm practice solutions implemented in Python. It is a place where I document my learning journey in algorithms and share my code with others.

## Repository Structure
- **Problems**: Each problem is stored in a separate Python file, named descriptively to indicate the problem it solves.
- **README**: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use the code.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
     ```
2. **Run the Code**:
   - Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to run.
   - Use the following command to execute the Python script:
     ```
     python problem_file_name.py
     ```
